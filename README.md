**Additional features:**

`/_map` shows the locations of the users who made the most recent 100 changes to the contents of the wiki) on a map.

`/_history[PAGE_RE].json` shows the detailed info of all the history versions of `[PAGE_RE]` (including subject, which is `[PAGE_RE]`, content, and the time it was created) in a json file if `[PAGE_RE]` already exists; if `[PAGE_RE]` does not exist, just return an empty json. (`[PAGE_RE]` is the name of the subject page.)

`/_map` and `/_history[PAGE_RE]` are cached using `Memcached` (if a page already exists). In other words, every time you reload the page, a message `"queried ([0-9]+) second/seconds ago"` will show up on the bottom right corner, which tells you the age of the query that generated this page. 

`/_flush` will delete all the cache and then redirect to the mainpage `/`.
